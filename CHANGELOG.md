## [0.2.4] - 2026-03-17

### Added

  - All instruction files automatically merged into system prompts for every LLM call
- Hierarchical bash command permission system
  - New `BashHierarchy` utility for generating progressive permission rules
  - Supports approval at multiple granularity levels (e.g., "npm", "npm install", "npm install lodash")
  - Wildcard pattern matching for command prefixes
- TUI slash command system refactored with declarative command registry
  - New `useCommands` hook centralizes slash command definitions

### Changed

- Separated `/memory` (instruction files) from `/mem` (stored memories) in interactive REPL
  - `/memory` now exclusively manages AGENTS.md, ALEXI.md, and rule files
  - `/mem` continues to handle JSON-based memory storage (list, search, stats, export)
- Updated agent system to track native vs custom agents

  - Better handling of "no image in clipboard" scenarios
  - Unified error handling across all clipboard tools
- Updated dependency versions
  - vitest: 4.0.0 → 4.1.0
  - @vitest/coverage-v8: 4.0.0 → 4.1.0
  - @vitejs/plugin-react: 5.2.0 → 6.0.1
  - @types/node: 25.3.5 → 25.5.0
  - @typescript-eslint/parser: 8.56.1 → 8.57.0
  - @commitlint/config-conventional: 20.4.3 → 20.5.0

### Fixed

- TUI slash commands now properly intercepted before being sent to LLM
  - Commands like `/help`, `/exit`, `/model` no longer leak to the AI
  - `useCommands` hook wired into App.tsx to handle all slash commands
- Command Palette (Ctrl+K) now displays all registered slash commands
  - Fixed empty command list issue
  - Commands populated from `useCommands` hook registry

## [0.2.3] - 2026-03-16

### Changed

- Updated documentation workflow with improved diff truncation and validation

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed

- `Ctrl+V` screenshot paste on macOS now works without installing `pngpaste` — added native `osascript` fallback that uses AppleScript to read clipboard images

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed

- Slash commands (`/help`, `/model`, `/exit`, etc.) were leaking directly to the LLM in the TUI instead of being intercepted by the command handler

  - Added tests for glob tool (16+ test cases covering pattern matching, recursive search)
  - Added tests for grep tool (20+ test cases covering regex patterns, file filtering, line matching)
  - All tests use temporary directories with proper cleanup
  - Tests verify actual file system changes, not just return values
  - Mock permission system to bypass checks during testing
