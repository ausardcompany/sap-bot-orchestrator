## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.3] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- Inline autocomplete system for TUI slash commands with keyboard navigation
- osascript fallback for clipboard image paste on macOS (eliminates pngpaste dependency)
- Comprehensive test coverage for clipboard functionality including platform detection and fallback mechanisms

### Changed

- TUI InputBox component now displays autocomplete suggestions when typing slash commands
- Keyboard navigation enhanced with Tab/Shift+Tab for autocomplete selection and Up/Down arrow key support
- Clipboard image reading now prioritizes pngpaste but falls back to native osascript on macOS
- Documentation workflow improved with better diff truncation and validation reporting

### Fixed

- Slash commands now properly intercepted by useCommands hook instead of leaking to LLM
- Command Palette now correctly displays all registered slash commands
- macOS clipboard paste no longer requires external pngpaste installation

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed

- `Ctrl+V` screenshot paste on macOS now works without installing `pngpaste` — added native `osascript` fallback that uses AppleScript to read clipboard images

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed

- Slash commands (`/help`, `/model`, `/exit`, etc.) were leaking directly to the LLM in the TUI instead of being intercepted by the command handler
- Command Palette (`Ctrl+K`) was opening with an empty command list

### Added

- Inline autocomplete for slash commands in the TUI input box — shows filtered suggestions when typing `/`
- Keyboard navigation (Up/Down/Tab) and acceptance (Enter/Tab) for autocomplete suggestions
- Command Palette now displays all 11 registered slash commands
