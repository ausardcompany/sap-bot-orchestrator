/**
 * Shared Agent Board schema migration.
 *
 * Ports upstream kilocode `packages/opencode/src/kilocode/board/store.ts`
 * (+ migration `20260828074139_kilocode_board.ts`, commit `162e30d23`).
 *
 * The Alexi migration runner (`src/core/database/migration.ts`) is
 * adapter-agnostic: it drives a `MigrationTx` whose only writer method is
 * `record(id)`. Actual DDL is issued through the caller's SQL adapter,
 * so we keep the SQL statements exported as constants (used by the
 * `run(sql)` wiring in `boardStore.ts`) and provide a thin `up()` that
 * dispatches those statements via the transaction interface. Concrete
 * migration adapters extend `MigrationTx` with an `execute(sql)` hook —
 * this file uses that hook when present, and no-ops when the adapter has
 * not yet wired it, so the schema can also be created eagerly by
 * `BoardStore.ensureSchema()` at first use.
 *
 * Alexi_change: no Effect-TS. The upstream migration is written in the
 * effect-sql style (`yield* tx.execute(...)`); Alexi's runner is plain
 * async / await, so we translate the same DDL into ordered `execute` calls.
 */

/**
 * Ordered DDL applied by this migration. Exported so `BoardStore` can

 * driver is wired up (e.g. tests spinning up a fresh `better-sqlite3`
