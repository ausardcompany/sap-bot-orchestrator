## Recommendations

Based on the changes, the following files in Alexi should be reviewed:

- No specific recommendations - review changes manually

## Your Task

Create a **detailed update plan** for Alexi based on the changes above.

### File Mapping
- Tool system changes → `src/tool/`
- Agent system changes → `src/agent/`
- Permission system changes → `src/permission/`
- Event bus changes → `src/bus/`
- Core orchestration changes → `src/core/`
- Provider changes → `src/providers/`
- Router changes → `src/router/`
- CLI changes → `src/cli/`

### For Each Change, Provide:
1. **File path** to modify (or create)
2. **Function/class** to change
3. **Code snippet** showing the exact change (before/after or new code)
4. **Priority**: critical | high | medium | low
5. **Reasoning**: Why this change is needed

### Important Considerations
- Maintain compatibility with SAP AI Core integration
- Preserve existing SAP-specific customizations
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Prioritize: security fixes > bug fixes > features > refactoring
- Do NOT include changes that would break existing functionality

### Output Format
